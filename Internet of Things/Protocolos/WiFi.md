# How WiFi works

WiFi, short for Wireless Fidelity, is a technology that enables wireless connection to the Internet. It works by transmitting data via radio waves between devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets and routers.

## Main components:

- Router: Device that connects your home network to the internet and sends and receives WiFi signals.
- Wireless adapter: Device built into your computer or smartphone that enables connection to WiFi networks.
- Antenna: Component of the router or wireless adapter that sends and receives WiFi signals.

## WiFi standards:

There are different WiFi standards that define the speed, frequency and other characteristics of the connection. The most common are:

- 802.11b/g/n: Older standards with lower speed and range.
- 802.11ac: Offers higher speed and range than the previous standards.
- 802.11ax (WiFi 6): The latest standard, with higher speed, capacity and efficiency.

## Connection process:

- The device searches for available WiFi networks.
- Select the desired network and enter the password if necessary.
- The device authenticates with the router.
- The connection is established and the device can access the internet.

## Security:

Security is an important aspect in WiFi networks. The following measures are recommended:

- Strong password: Use a complex password that is difficult to guess.
- Encryption: Enable WPA2 encryption to protect transmitted information.
- Guest network: Create a separate WiFi network for guests.

## Advantages of WiFi:

- Mobility: Allows wireless Internet connection.
- Flexibility: The Internet can be accessed from anywhere within range of the network.
- Cost: It is a relatively inexpensive technology.

## Disadvantages of WiFi:

- Range: WiFi signal can be affected by distance and obstructions.
- Interference: Other wireless devices can interfere with the WiFi signal.
- Security: WiFi networks can be vulnerable to attack if proper security measures are not taken.

## In a nutshell:

WiFi is a popular technology that enables wireless connection to the Internet. It offers a number of advantages such as mobility and flexibility, but it also has some disadvantages such as range and security. It is important to know the components, standards, connection process and security measures to take full advantage of WiFi.
